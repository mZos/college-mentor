What is Programming?
Just like we use Hindi or English to communicate with each other, we use a Programming language to communicate with the computer.

Programming is a way to instruct the computer to perform various tasks.

What is Python?
Python is a simple and easy-to-understand language that feels like reading simple English. This Pseudo code nature of Python makes it easy to learn and understandable for beginners.

Features of Python:
Easy to understand = Less development time
Free and open source
High-level language
Portable – works on Windows/Linux/Mac + Fun to work with :)

Installation:

Python can be easily installed from python.org
When you click on the download button, python can be installed right after you complete the setup by executing the file for your platform.

Tip: Just install it like a game ☻



Chapter 1: Modules, Comments & Pip:

Let’s write our very first python program.

Create a file called hello.py and paste the below code into it

print(“Hello World”)         # print is a function (more later)

Execute this file (.py file) by typing python hello.py, and you will see Hello World printed on the screen.

Modules
A module is a file containing code written by somebody else (usually) which can be imported and used in our programs.

Pip
Pip is a package manager for python. You can use pip to install a module on your system.

E.g., pip install flask (It will install flask module in your system)

Types of modules
There are two types of modules in Python:

Built-in modules – Pre-installed in Python
External modules – Need to install using pip
Some examples of built-in modules are os, abc, etc.

Some examples of external modules are TensorFlow, flask, etc.

Using Python as a Calculator

We can use python as a calculator by typing “python” + TO DO on the terminal. [It opens REPL or read evaluation print loop]



 
Comments
Comments are used to write something which the programmer does not want to execute.

Comments can be used to mark the author's name, date, etc.

Types of Comments:

There are two types of comments in python,

Single line comments – Written using # (pound/hash symbol)
Multi-line comments – Written using ‘’’ Comment ‘’’ or “”” Comment “””.

Chapter 1 – Practice Set
Write a program to print Twinkle-Twinkle Little Star poem in python.
Use REPL and print the table of 5 using it.
Install an external module and use it to perform an operation of your interest.
Write a python program to print the contents of a directory using os module. Search online for the function which does that.
Label the program written in problem 4 with comments.


Chapter 2 – Variables and Data Types
A variable is a name given to a memory location in a program. For example

a=30

b=”Harry”

c=71.22
Variable – Container to store a value

Keywords – Reserved words in Python

Identifiers – class/function/variable name

Data Types:
Primarily there are the following data types in Python:

Integers
Floating point numbers
Strings
Booleans
None
Python is a fantastic language that automatically identifies the type of data for us.

a = 71        #Identifies a as class<int>

b = 88.44     #Identifies b as class<float>

name = “Harry”  #Identifies name as class<Str>

Rules for defining a variable name: (Also applicable to other identifiers)

A variable name can contain alphabets, digits, and underscore.
A variable name can only start with an alphabet and underscore.
A variable can’t start with a digit.
No white space is allowed to be used inside a variable name.
Examples of few valid variable names,

Harry, harry, one8, _akki, aakash, harry_bro, etc.

 
Operators in Python
The following are some common operators in Python:

Arithmetic Operators (+, -, *, /, etc.)
Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)
Comparison Operators (==, >=, <=, >, <, !=, etc.)
Logical Operators (and, or, not)
type() function and Typecasting

type function is used to find the data type of a given variable in Python.

a = 31

type(a)                      #class<int>

b = “31”

type(b)                      #class<str>
A number can be converted into a string and vice versa (if possible)

There are many functions to convert one data type into another.

Str(31)           # ”31” Integer to string conversion

int(“32”)       # 32 String to int conversion

float(32)       #32.0 Integer to float conversion
… and so on

Here “31” is a string literal, and 31 is a numeric literal.

input() function

This function allows the user to take input from the keyboard as a string.

a = input(“Enter name”)               #if a is “harry”, the user entered harry
Note: The output of the input function is always a string even if the number is entered by the user.

Suppose if a user enters 34, then this 34 will automatically convert to “34” string literal.

Chapter 2 – Practice Set :->

Write a Python program to add two numbers.
Write a Python program to find the remainder when a number is divided by Z(Integer).
Check the type of the variable assigned using the input() function.
Use a comparison operator to find out whether a given variable a is greater than b or not. (Take a=34 and b=80)
Write a Python program to find the average of two numbers entered by the user.
Write a Python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.
